How can outlier values be treated?
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
     Can be dropped if it's garbage value
  * e.g. height = abc ft, then it's string value instead of int or float, hence can be dropped
        * if it's extreme value, it can be removed
     If you cannot drop outliers, you can try
        * a different model
